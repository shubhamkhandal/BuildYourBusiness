 FIND A GOOD BUSINESS IDEA
A good business idea isn’t just one that turns a profit.
 It’s one that’s a good fit for you personally, for your target market, and for your location.
 Hopefully you’re going to be in business for a long time, so pick something you love.
 CHOOSE THE TYPE OF BUSINESS YOU WANT TO START
A traditional business isn’t right for everyone. If you want to hit the ground running with a tried-and-tested business model,
 a franchise may be a better fit for you, or if you like the idea of doing good at the same time, why not a nonprofit, or a social enterprise?
 DO YOUR MARKET RESEARCH
One of the best ways to figure out whether or not you’ve hit upon a good idea is to get out and start talking to real people—do they really want a fancy Basque restaurant in their neighborhood or is another donut shop going to be more to their taste?
<h4>4.BUSINESS MANAGEMENT</h4>
You're up and running and looking for opportunities to grow your business—and your revenue.
 Strong business management is your key to success.
 And the two best things you can do to manage your business successfully are to make sure you understand your financials and to develop marketing strategies that are based on real data and customer feedback.
 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
A solid knowledge of accounting principles is essential for every small business owner, but if you’re not a numbers person, you’re not alone.
 These articles will teach you the foundations if you’re new to accounting, or refresh your memory if you’re rusty.
